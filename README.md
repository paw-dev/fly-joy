# Fly&Joy â€“ Travel Ticket Booking Website (First Version)

This project was originally created for a travel agency as part of my frontend developer training.  
It represents the **first version** of a real-world ticket booking website.

## Description

Fly Joy is a responsive single-page website designed for a travel agency.  
It includes a contact form, navigation menu, and a clean layout adapted for **mobile**, **tablet**, and **desktop** devices.

The site was initially built using **HTML** and **CSS** and later integrated into **WordPress** for production use.  
Although the current live version has since been redesigned and extended, this version reflects the original structure and design delivered to the client.

## Features

- Responsive layout (mobile, tablet, desktop)  
- Contact form  
- Navigation menu  
- Modern clean design  
- Built with semantic HTML and custom CSS

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Responsive Web Design principles

## Notes

This is a static, standalone version of the original project.  
The full WordPress integration and backend functionality were developed outside this repository.
